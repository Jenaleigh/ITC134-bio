My name is Jenaleigh Fox. I am a programming and database management student at Seattle Central College. 
I used to live the seasonal-field-research life of an environmental scientist. 
Collecting scientific data and working outside is a dream, but I am tired of moving for work, 
constantly applying to new seasonal jobs, and low pay.
I am transitioning to a career in tech.
I hope that programming and database management will open up more lucrative career opportunities, and keep me in the city!
